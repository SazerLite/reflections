How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It makes it a lot more quick to find any mistakes made instead of having to scan through the files manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

In case the newer version causes more problems than the previous version. You could also use some older code in the newer code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: Choose logical points to commit, making it easier to look back at specific changes. Con: Could forget to manually save, thus losing progress.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is specifically designed for programming, while Google Docs can be used for more universal or casual purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives a list of commits done to the file. You can use git diff to show the changes made between two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Simple. You can just jump back and undo said bug without worrying about causing more problems.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To make very clear and efficient updates and tests to my programs and recover from any mistakes.
