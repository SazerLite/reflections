When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have to work with collaborators or on other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case there are changes that are not ready to be implemented into your local or GitHub repository.
